### Mail

### PvP Rating System
* When someone kills someone else the killer's rating increases and victim's rating decreases.
* The average rating is 1500.
* If you kill someone who is really good at pvp your score will increase more than if you had killed someone who sucks at pvp.
* Rd = rating confidence, 200 is default. (lower is better).
* Real = (Rating / Rd) * 100, It someone's real pvp rating it's accurate then the rating.
* The rating system using the glicko2 algorithm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system.
